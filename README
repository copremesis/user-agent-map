so if I make a new model called queue which is the same as the property_compare table ...

or just a list of ids whith a status



jobs => foreign_key, status, date

  jobs is a list of properties to be processed.

worker => 

  performes phase1 and phase2 on the job

scraper => inserts property into the appropriate work_queue

I suppose the name of the class would be called 

Backlog

  which manages a set of work_queues where are each a job model with specifc jobs

maybe it would be wise to learn resque !!!


Your need to produce Backlog would be an attempt to study resque by implementing your own version.

Know this then you know how to get better performance /parallel and load balancing awareness
Something that will make life much easier as we being working on auto or other aspects that
involve integration:
test processing(scraping):
